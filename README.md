## This is my second project "StepTracker"

This application provides the following functionality:
1. Console interface for communicate with the program.
2. Storage of data on the number of steps taken for several months.
3. Enter your goal for the number of steps per day.
4. Enter the number of steps taken per day.
5. Display statistics for the specified month.
